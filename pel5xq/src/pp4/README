Notes on PP4

The error output will differ from the provided output in the following ways:
- With arrays/strings not needing to be implemented for 4620, errors about using integers in NewArray and array subscripting, the .length() method for arrays, and other such errors will differ from the expected output.



- For checking inherited type signatures, classes are checked before interfaces. This casues an order difference in my bad6 from the given bad6.
- For checking missing declarations, classes are checked, then interfaces, then functions. This causes an order difference in my bad3 from the given bad3.
